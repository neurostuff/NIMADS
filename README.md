# NIMADS

The Neuroimaging Meta-Analysis Data Standard (NIMADS) is a standard for organizing and annotating
meta-analytic data from neuroimaging (especially fMRI) studies.

NIMADS is specified in a series of [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org) files,
each of which describes a single element of the standard.

NIMADS is still under active development.
If you would like to contribute to NIMADS, or even just ask a question about it,
please either [open an issue](https://github.com/neurostuff/NIMADS/issues/new) or
get in touch with us [on Mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/nimare).
